# Oil-Management-System
Manages the daily data of a oil company. How much profit and loss done. How much production and demand is there of the oil sector by sector.

Problem:

This project targets to built a system efficient to handle various

functions that are required for proper management and

working of an oil company. The goal is to create a program

using python and its libraries which can help in the task of

managing the system.


Components:

The various functions/libraries of python that are used in this

project are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Object-Oriented

Programming Concepts like classes and objects, and File

handling concepts.


Features of this project:

The program is created by using python and its various libraries.

The program is to be executed by using windows power-shell.

The program is made in an interactive way for the user to
navigate through various features.

User has to follow the on- screen instructions to utilize the various function.

This program has various features listed as below:

1. Customer Management

2. Employee Management

3. Production Management

4. Demand Management

5. Profit/Loss Data and graph.

Points 1-4 provide basic functions like adding a row in the data,

searching a row based on a respective unique id, deleting a

row from the data based on a respective unique id. These are

implemented with the use of classes and objects.

Point 5 provides the data of profit/loss data calculated from
previously acquired data from production and demand files. 

The various statistical data is printed on the screen based on
the calculations. 

This data can be used to monitor the
growth/decline of the company. 

Next, this data is plotted on the graph using Matplotlib. 

The various graphs printed can be used to demonstrating the
growth/decline over the period. 

The data acquired from these features are exported to the
respective excel sheets, so that no data is loss after the
termination of the program. 

One can also open this excel files
to view/edit the data in it.
